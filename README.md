// Routing

// We can do routing in the middleware functions by passing a extra parameter/argument.

// NOTE- VERY VERY IMPORTANT

// The order of the middleware function matters a lot in routing because if we visited "/mypage" but we have written the middleware function with route "/" and "/mypage" later than it will excecute "/". 

// Hence order of middleware functions in routing matters a lot.
